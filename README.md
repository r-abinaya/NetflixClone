# NetflixClone

The Netflix Clone frontend is a web-based application that I have worked on as part of a personal project. The application is a clone of the popular video streaming platform, Netflix, and is built using React.

The main features of the application include a homepage displaying popular movies and TV shows, a search bar that allows users to search for movies and TV shows, and pages displaying details about movies and TV shows, including trailers and episodes.
